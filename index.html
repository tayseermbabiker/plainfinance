                        <p>This is one of the most common frustrations for business owners. Profit is an accounting concept that doesn't account for timing—when customers pay you vs when you pay suppliers. Your P&L might show profit, but if customers owe you money or you've stocked up on inventory, that cash isn't in your bank yet. PlainFinancials shows you exactly where your cash is tied up with a simple "cash bridge" explanation.</p>

                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Cash runway is how many months your business can survive on its current cash, assuming no new income. Calculate it by dividing your cash in bank by your average monthly expenses (or "burn rate"). If you have $30,000 cash and spend $10,000/month, you have 3 months of runway. PlainFinancials calculates this automatically from your numbers and warns you when runway gets dangerously low.</p>

                        <p>No. Your accountant handles compliance—VAT filing, bookkeeping, annual returns. We translate their output into insights you can actually use for decisions. Think of us as the explanation layer between your accountant's reports and your business decisions.</p>
