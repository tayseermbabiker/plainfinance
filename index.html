                        <p>This is one of the most common frustrations for business owners. Profit is an accounting concept that doesn't account for timing—when customers pay you vs when you pay suppliers. Your P&L might show profit, but if customers owe you money or you've stocked up on inventory, that cash isn't in your bank yet. PlainFinancials shows you exactly where your cash is tied up with a simple "cash bridge" explanation.</p>

                        <p>Focus on: Revenue (are sales growing?), Cost of Goods Sold (what it costs to deliver), Operating Expenses (overhead), Net Profit (what's left), Cash in Bank (can you pay bills?), and Accounts Receivable (money owed to you).

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Cash runway is how many months your business can survive on its current cash, assuming no new income. Calculate it by dividing your cash in bank by your average monthly expenses (or "burn rate"). If you have $30,000 cash and spend $10,000/month, you have 3 months of runway. PlainFinancials calculates this automatically from your numbers and warns you when runway gets dangerously low.</p>

                        <p>Three common reasons: customers are paying late (your money is stuck in receivables), you're holding too much inventory, or you're paying suppliers faster than customers pay you. This timing mismatch is called the "cash conversion cycle." PlainFinancials analyzes your numbers and tells you exactly which of these is causing your cash crunch—and what to do about it.</p>

If you have less than 2-3 months of expenses covered, you need to act fast. PlainFinancials does this math for you and gives you a clear "cash forecast" showing your projected balance for the next 3 months.</p>
