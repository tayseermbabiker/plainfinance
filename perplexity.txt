Ideas that fit your exact profile
1) “Bank pack in a click” (ACCA + AI + n8n)
Pipeline: n8n pulls TB and P&L from Xero/QuickBooks/Wafeq, your cloud code standardizes it, AI drafts a bank‑style summary.​

Output: clean financials + covenant ratios + plain‑English overview for lenders, tailored to Gulf banks’ expectations.

2) Automated chart‑of‑accounts cleaner
Use n8n to fetch COA / TB exports, cloud functions to map to your standardized templates per sector, AI to explain changes.​

ACCA + audit background lets you embed “best practice” mappings others cannot fake.

3) “60‑minute budget & cash plan” wizard
Web UI + AI questions, then cloud code builds a 12‑month P&L and cash forecast, and n8n can push it back to Google Sheets or the accounting system.​

Great for US and Gulf micro‑SMEs who will never touch full FP&A tools.

4) Accounting data quality scanner
Upload TB / GL; cloud code runs audit‑style checks, flags issues (mis‑classified VAT, negative balances, missing accruals); AI explains each finding in plain language.​

5) Sector “mini‑SaaS” verticals
Reuse your PlainFinance engine with different front ends:

F&B cash and margin coach (table‑turns, food cost, delivery fees).​

Freelancer / agency health check (utilization, effective hourly rate, runway).​

Your mix of ACCA, FP&A, audit, n8n, and AI means you can own the “explain and fix my numbers” niche for SMEs, while competitors stay either in pure software or pure consulting.
