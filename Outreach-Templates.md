### 1. Launch Announcement Post

```
I've been the "finance friend" for years.

You know the one — the person non-finance founders call when they get their monthly reports and think "what does any of this mean?"

I've explained EBITDA over coffee more times than I can count.
I've translated "DSO of 47 days" into "your customers are paying too slow."
I've turned panic into "oh, that's actually fine" hundreds of times.

After 17 years doing this at ADNOC, JTI, and for friends who run businesses...

I built the tool I wish existed.

Introducing PlainFinance:
→ Upload your financial data
→ Get a report that actually makes sense
→ Written like a friend explaining, not an accountant lecturing

No jargon. No confusion. Just "here's what's happening, here's if it's good or bad, here's what to do."

We're launching soon.

If you've ever stared at a spreadsheet thinking "is this good?" — this is for you.

### 2. Problem-Focused Post (Week 2)

```
Confession: I used to judge business owners who didn't understand their financials.

Then I realized something.

These are people who:
• Built companies from nothing
• Employ dozens of people
• Make million-dirham decisions

They're not stupid. They just never learned finance — because they were too busy building.

And the finance industry? We've made it worse:

"Your EBITDA margin is compressing due to elevated COGS as a percentage of revenue, impacting your operating leverage."

Translation: "You're spending more to make stuff, so profit is shrinking."

Why do we make it so complicated?

That's why I built PlainFinance.

Upload your numbers. Get plain English explanations. Actually understand your business.

Because you shouldn't need an accounting degree to know if you're doing well.

Launching soon. Link in bio.

### 3. Value Post - Common Mistakes

```
5 things your financial reports are trying to tell you (but you're missing):

1. "Cash ≠ Profit"
You can be profitable and run out of money. If customers pay you in 60 days but you pay suppliers in 30 days — you have a cash flow problem.

2. "Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity"
Growing sales 50% means nothing if you're losing money on every sale. Check your margins.

3. "That 'good month' might be a warning"
Record sales with record expenses = same profit. Growth that costs too much isn't growth.

4. "Your accountant's silence isn't approval"
They're paid to record, not advise. No news isn't good news — it's just no news.

5. "The balance sheet is a snapshot, not a movie"
You need to see trends over time, not just one month. One data point tells you nothing.

Wish someone would just explain your numbers in plain English?

That's literally what PlainFinance does.

### 4. LinkedIn DM - Cold Outreach

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question — do you actually understand your company's financial reports?

I ask because I've spent 17 years as a finance person, and I know how often business owners nod along pretending to get it.

I just built something for exactly this: PlainFinance

You upload your financials, and it spits out a report that actually makes sense. Plain English. What happened, why, what to do.

Not trying to sell you — just curious if this would've been useful for you when you were [scaling/starting/growing].

Worth a quick look?
```

### 5. LinkedIn DM - Warm Outreach (Friends)

```
Hey [Name]!

Remember all those times you called me asking "what does this mean?" about your financials?

I finally built a thing for that 😄

It's called PlainFinance — upload your numbers, get a report that actually makes sense. No jargon, just plain English explanations.

You're literally the person I built this for.

Would you try it when we launch? Free for friends, obviously.

Also — know other founders who'd want this? I'm looking for early testers.

### 1. Cold Email - Startup Founder

**Subject:** Your financials, but actually understandable

```
Hi [Name],

Random question: When you get your monthly financial reports, do you actually understand them?

Or do you skim, hope nothing's on fire, and get back to building?

(Most founders I know choose option 2.)

I'm Tayseer — FCCA, 17 years in finance, built PlainFinance because I was tired of watching smart founders fly blind on their numbers.

What it does:
- Upload your Excel/CSV financial data
- Get a 1-page report in plain English
- "What happened, is it good or bad, what to do about it"

No jargon. No 50-page reports. Just clarity.

We're launching soon. Early users get 50% off for life.

Interested? Just reply "yes" and I'll add you to the list.

— Tayseer

P.S. If you've ever Googled "what is EBITDA" or asked your accountant to "explain it like I'm five" — this is for you.

### 2. Email to ACCA Network

**Subject:** Built something for non-finance people (referral opportunity)

```
Hi fellow ACCAs,

I've built a tool and I need your help spreading the word.

It's called PlainFinance — and it's for non-finance business owners who don't understand their own numbers.

You know the type:
- Call you asking "is this good or bad?"
- Nod along in meetings pretending to understand
- Make gut decisions because they can't interpret data

PlainFinance translates financial reports into plain English. Upload data, get a simple briefing with action items.

Why I'm telling you:
1. Your clients might benefit (and it's not competition — we don't do bookkeeping/audit)
2. I'm offering referral fees for early users
3. You might want to try it yourself for client communication

Happy to chat more if interesting.

**Subject:** Re: Your financials, but actually understandable

```
Hi [Name],

Just floating this back up.

TL;DR: I built a tool that turns confusing financial reports into plain English explanations with specific action items.

If you've ever looked at your P&L and thought "...so am I doing well or not?" — this is for you.

Launching soon. Reply "in" to join the waitlist.

No pressure either way!

**Title:** Built a tool that explains financial reports in plain English — looking for feedback

```
Hey everyone,

I'm a finance professional (FCCA, 17 years experience) who got tired of watching smart business owners struggle to understand their own numbers.

The problem: Financial reports are written by accountants, for accountants. If you're a founder/owner, you get spreadsheets full of jargon and have no idea if you're doing well or dying.

The solution I built: PlainFinance

Upload your financial data (Excel, CSV, accounting export)
Get a 1-page report that explains:

- What happened this month (in plain English)
- Is this good or bad?
- What should you do about it?

Example:
Instead of "DSO increased to 47 days with AR aging showing 34% in 60+ bucket"
You get "Customers are taking too long to pay you. AED 78K is overdue. Call Ahmed at XYZ Co first — he owes the most."

Looking for:
- Feedback on the concept
- Beta testers when we launch (free access for early users)
- Honest "this already exists" reality checks

Would this have been useful for you?

No accounting degree required.
